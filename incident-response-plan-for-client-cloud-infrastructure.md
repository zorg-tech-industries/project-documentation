# Incident Response Plan for Client Cloud Infrastructure

## High-level incident response plan for the client's cloud infrastructure:

1. **Detection and Reporting:**
    - **SIEM Alerts:** All SIEM alerts will be analyzed and investigated by the security team.
    - **Other Sources:** Incidents can also be detected through other sources like security tools, manual checks, or reports from users.
    - **Reporting:** All suspected incidents will be documented and reported to the designated personnel following established procedures.

2. **Initial Triage:**
    - **Severity Assessment:** The security team will assess the severity of the incident based on predefined criteria (e.g., impact, potential data loss).
    - **Containment:** Immediate actions will be taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage. This may involve isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, or stopping malicious processes.
    - **Initial Analysis:** Initial investigation will gather evidence and determine the nature and scope of the incident.

3. **Investigation and Mitigation:**
    - **In-depth Analysis:** Depending on the severity, a deeper investigation may be required involving forensic analysis and external support.
    - **Eradication:** The root cause of the incident will be identified and addressed to prevent future occurrences.
    - **Recovery:** Affected systems and data will be restored according to backup and recovery procedures.

4. **Communication and Documentation:**
    - **Internal Communication:** Relevant stakeholders will be kept informed throughout the incident response process.
    - **External Communication:** If required, communication with external parties like law enforcement or customers will follow established protocols.
    - **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the incident, response actions, and lessons learned will be maintained for future reference and improvement.

5. **Post-Incident Activities:**
    - **Review and Improvement:** The incident will be reviewed to identify areas for improvement in detection, response, and prevention.
    - **Lessons Learned:** Findings from the review will be shared with the team and incorporated into future security practices.
    - **Testing and Drills:** Simulated incident response exercises will be conducted regularly to ensure team preparedness.
