| Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - `10.0.0.0/16` | On AWS, we created a Virtual Private Cloid (VPC) with the network CIDR of `10.0.0.0/16` to allow us to create multiple subnets, which we separated into a public and private subnets as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Internet Gateway (IGW)                      | Next is an Internet Gateway, which we will assign to our VPC. This will allow us to route outbound internet traffic so out instances, even those hosted on private subnets, can open connections to the internet for new packages, software updates, and critical security updates from upstream like Microsoft (Windows server) and Ubuntu (Linux data servers)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Customer Gateways (CGW)                     | Customer Gateways (CGW) are one half of the components that build the our Virtual Private Network (VPN) to AWS. CGW were individually deployed with each team member's public IP address (a CGW per IP) so to connect their pfSense routers, and subsequent internal local area networks (LANs), to the AWS infrastructure through an encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel individually created for each pfSense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Virtual Private Gateway (VPG)               | This is the secondary compontent of a VPN tunnel, representing the point of connection to our VPC. All that is necessary here is to attach it to the VPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Virtual Private Network (VPN) Tunnel        | When creating a VPN Tunnel, we define the VPG and CGW being connected (setting the entry/exit points for the tunnel), and then establish the internal networks of those endpoints. While we could allow all traffic from any internal networks past the endpoints, we've limited it here to `10.0.0.0/16` (our VPC and its various subnets) and a `172.16.x.x/24` network specific to that CGW. <br><br>We accomplished setting up a pfSense router VM on Bridged mode and an internal network following the `172.16.x.y/24` convention. Each different simulated on-premise router was assigned a different `x` for their lan (so one location has a `172.16.1.0/24` network and the next would have `172.16.2.0/24`. This was done to avoid any possible IP conflicts and for security logging purposes. |
| Subnet 01 (Public) - `10.0.1.0/24`          | Our first subnet -- `10.0.1.0/24` is only utilized to house our NAT Gateway so our instances on our private subnet are capable of accessing the internet without having a public IP address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
